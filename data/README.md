# Data Directory

This folder centralizes all datasets used by the project.

- `raw/`: immutable source data as obtained from sensors, vendors, or manual exports.
- `processed/`: cleaned and feature-ready datasets generated by the preprocessing pipeline.

Place new files inside the matching subdirectory and describe any non-obvious schema
changes directly in the related notebook or preprocessing script.
